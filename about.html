                                <p class="reveal-right">I am a senior at Penn State University studying nutritional sciences with a busy schedule focusing in basic science and dietetics. I began schooling by attending Penn State Berks in Reading, Pennsylvania, my hometown. After two years I transferred to Penn State University Park with intentions to complete my degree.</p>

                                <p class="reveal-right">I am interested in just about all aspects of nutrition, but there are a select few that really resonate with me. </p>

                                    <p class="reveal-right">As overweight and obesity rates in the nation are increasing, so are the associated risk factors for disease such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. I am interested in promoting proactive lifestyles through healthcare and community in the population to help avoid these increasing numbers. I think people are slowly realizing that what and how we eat affects us in more ways than previously thought. This shown not only through the endless Pinterest healthy food boards, or Instagramâ€™s many health food gurus with thousands of followers, but also the rising demand for nutrition professional in the workforce.</p>

                                    <p class="reveal-right">This is a topic that is not always thought of as directly associated to nutrition, however it is actually a huge aspect of nutrition. If inefficiencies occur in the food system, it can translate to an increased price in the grocery store which then can affect the quality and quantity of food that consumers are purchasing. Referring to how dietitians counsel patients, if the patients do not have the means to purchase the foods that they were advised to consume, then how can we even properly do our job? </p>
                                    <p class="reveal-right">Approaching this with a different perspective, the current agriculture and production methods especially paired with American consumer habits, are causing a slow depletion of resources. I am interested in exploring the food system more to see how nutrition professionals can help increase sustainability in all measures.</p>

                                    <h3 class="h5 text-secondary reveal-left mb-0">Community nutrition - education and engagement</h2>
                                    <p class="reveal-right">I believe that community nutrition is a vital aspect of a healthy and functional society. Dietitians and other nutrition professionals are able to reach and impact large populations of people with education about food and nutrition. This nutrition education and community engagement can help people make more informed choices with their food consequently improving their overall health. In increasing the health of people in our society, we could decrease healthcare costs, avoid certain chronic disease development, as well as improve our quality of life. </p>

                            <p class="reveal-right">I've always had a passion for appreciating good food. The obsession started when I was little and pretended to be on a food cooking show. Back then my creations consisted of chocolate drizzled bagels on a Barbie plate.</p>
                            <p class="reveal-right">My appreciation of food probably stemmed from growing up around my family's Chinese restaurant, the Far East Restaurant, in Berks County, Pennsylvania. I was taught as much as a young child could understand about the basics of cooking, waitressing, and food preparation there. There was a time when I even wanted to start my own restaurant.</p>
