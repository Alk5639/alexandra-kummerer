                                <p>
                                        I am a graduate student studying at Cedar Crest College and a recent graduate from the Cedar
                                        Crest College Dietetic Internship Program. I received my B.S in Nutritional Sciences with a
                                        focus in dietetics and basic science from Penn State University where I was involved in a variety
                                        of different groups and activities like the Student Nutrition Association, the Student Farm Club,
                                        and the Penn State Rock Climbing Wall.
                                </p>
                                <p>I find myself drawn to many aspects of nutrition: clinical, community, and food service management and
                                        just about everything in between. Especially after completing my dietetic internship with Cedar Crest
                                        College, I realized that because of the nature of nutrition, every genre of nutrition has the ability to
                                        provide a positive impact to communities. As a kid thinking about what I wanted to grow up to be, I
                                        remember always thinking that I wanted to make an impact no matter what; I really wanted to
                                        make a difference in peoples&#39; lives. I feel that almost any genre of nutrition can help me achieve
                                        that dream.</p>

                                <p class="">I am interested in just about all aspects of nutrition, but there are a select few that really resonate with me. </p>
                                <div class="mb-4">
                                    <h3 class="h5 text-secondary mb-0">Preventative healthcare</h2>                                                        
                                    <p class="">As overweight and obesity rates in the nation are increasing, so are the associated risk factors for disease such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. I am interested in promoting proactive lifestyles through healthcare and community in the population to help avoid these increasing numbers. I think people are slowly realizing that what and how we eat affects us in more ways than previously thought. This shown not only through the endless Pinterest healthy food boards, or Instagramâ€™s many health food gurus with thousands of followers, but also the rising demand for nutrition professional in the workforce.</p>

                                    <p class="">This is a topic that is not always thought of as directly associated to nutrition, however it is actually a huge aspect of nutrition. If inefficiencies occur in the food system, it can translate to an increased price in the grocery store which then can affect the quality and quantity of food that consumers are purchasing. Referring to how dietitians counsel patients, if the patients do not have the means to purchase the foods that they were advised to consume, then how can we even properly do our job? </p>
                                    <p class="">Approaching this with a different perspective, the current agriculture and production methods especially paired with American consumer habits, are causing a slow depletion of resources. I am interested in exploring the food system more to see how nutrition professionals can help increase sustainability in all measures.</p>

                                    <h3 class="h5 text-secondary mb-0">Community nutrition - education and engagement</h2>
                                    <p class="">I believe that community nutrition is a vital aspect of a healthy and functional society. Dietitians and other nutrition professionals are able to reach and impact large populations of people with education about food and nutrition. This nutrition education and community engagement can help people make more informed choices with their food consequently improving their overall health. In increasing the health of people in our society, we could decrease healthcare costs, avoid certain chronic disease development, as well as improve our quality of life. </p>

                            <p class="">I've developed a huge interest in traveling nationally and internationally. I love to travel and learn about the culture and language of the land. I find that culture especially related to food and food systems is my favorite to learn about.In this featured picture I was in a Chilean seafood market in Santiago where I learned that the seafood is imported from a well known nearby port city called Valparaiso.</p>

                            <p class="">I've always had a passion for appreciating good food. The obsession started when I was little and pretended to be on a food cooking show. Back then my creations consisted of chocolate drizzled bagels on a Barbie plate.</p>
                            <p class="">My appreciation of food probably stemmed from growing up around my family's Chinese restaurant, the Far East Restaurant, in Berks County, Pennsylvania. I was taught as much as a young child could understand about the basics of cooking, waitressing, and food preparation there. There was a time when I even wanted to start my own restaurant.</p>

                            <p class="">One of my less extreme outdoor activities is gardening. I have a huge fascination with finding ways to live in a sustainable way, and using the ability to grow and harvest your own food is one of my favorite ways to do that.</p>
